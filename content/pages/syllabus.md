Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 session / week, 3 hours / session

Course Description
------------------

Still photography, a practice and form of expression that has worked its way into every facet of social life and every culture in the world, is considered here from the perspectives of history and social science. We will discuss the uses and functions of pictures; how they are to be understood and interpreted; whether they have clear-cut content and meanings; how they shape and are shaped by politics, economics, and social life.

Topics covered include photographs of the human face; spirit photography and deception; everyday vernacular photography (snapshots, postcards, scrapbooks, studios, itinerant photographers), both in our own society and elsewhere; imperial and colonial photography of non-western peoples; photography in anthropology; gender in advertising photography; political uses of photography in documentation and propaganda, particularly in the Great Depression of the 1930s.

A good deal of time, both in class and in "reading" assignments, will be devoted to examining and interpreting photographs. We will also see a number of videos concerned with still photography.

Writing and Class Assignments
-----------------------------

What matters most is staying up with reading and viewing assignments and participating actively in class. Several papers will be due during the semester, with details available on the {{% resource_link 80548199-2c50-8c7d-612f-31b79ed2467a "assignments" %}} page.
